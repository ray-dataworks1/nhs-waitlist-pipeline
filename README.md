# MediMart: NHS Waitlist Analytics Accelerator

## Project Summary

**MediMart** is an end-to-end NHS analytics accelerator, built as a simulated MVP to demonstrate modern, stakeholder-driven analytics engineering in UK healthcare. The project models the real-world elective care journey—from GP referral to Trust waitlist and final treatment—surfacing overdue cases, risk-stratified backlogs, and operational capacity mismatches for Trusts and ICSs.

**This repo demonstrates:**
- Migrating from legacy NHS/Power BI workflows to modern, modular analytics pipelines.
- Clear, testable logic with explainable metrics and “data lineage” at every stage.
- Rapid prototyping with UK NHS-inspired, fully synthetic data—optimized for analytics, not anonymisation.

---

## Data Provenance & Project Design

All data is **synthetic and UK-centric** (not Synthea/US-based), hand-crafted to reflect NHS structures, naming, and regional conventions.  
Core datasets include patients, GP referrals, Trusts, appointments, conditions, and procedures.  
Data is designed for rapid analytics prototyping and dashboarding. See [`/data`](./data) for full CSVs.

## Strategic Objectives

- **Reduce overdue elective cases:** Surface breaches and enable targeted interventions.
- **Prioritise high-risk patients:** Drive fair, clinically-informed stratification and reporting.
- **Reveal and resolve capacity mismatches:** Give operations teams a true view of backlog, resource gaps, and appointment/slot alignment.

## Stakeholder Personas

**Dr. Aisha Patel — Clinical Lead, NHS Trust**  
> “I need reliable, up-to-date visibility of patients breaching wait times, so we can intervene before outcomes deteriorate. Risk scoring must be clinically fair—not just a numbers game.”

**Ms. Emily Smith — ICS Operations Manager**  
> “I’m responsible for making sure our Trusts allocate resources efficiently. I want to track risk by site, condition, and tier, and spot where capacity isn’t meeting demand.”

## Stakeholder Discovery

| Area               | Stakeholder Question                                                     | Why It Matters                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Overdue Cases**  | Which patients have breached their expected wait time?                   | Prevents deteriorating outcomes         |
|                    | What are the common causes of delay?                                    | Surfaces fixable inefficiencies         |
|                    | Can we define a KPI to reduce breaches?                                 | Enables measurable improvements         |
| **Risk Backlogs**  | How many high-risk patients are in backlog?                             | Ensures fairness in prioritisation      |
|                    | Are delays/cancellations more likely for high-risk groups?              | Measures equity, guides resource use    |
| **Capacity**       | Are appointments aligning with demand?                                  | Assesses capacity planning in real-time |
|                    | Where are overbookings/cancellations most common?                       | Highlights operational bottlenecks      |
|                    | Would more non-clinical support help?                                   | Explores interventions, cost savings    |

## Data Model

**Key Tables:**
- `patients`: Patient master data (risk, demographic, etc.)
- `gp`: GP/practice registry
- `referrals`: Primary care referrals to Trusts (with urgency and specialty)
- `trusts`: NHS Trust (hospital/ICS) registry
- `appointments`: Elective care bookings, wait tracking
- `procedures`: Planned/performed treatments
- `conditions`: Comorbidities/risk drivers

*See [`/docs/NHS_Waitlist_ERD.png`](./docs/NHS_Waitlist_ERD.png) for a data model diagram.*

## Migration Story: From Legacy to Modern Analytics
**Legacy Workflow:**
- Data scattered across Excel, on-prem SQL Server, and unversioned Power BI reports.
- Hand-coded, hard-to-audit SQL queries/views; lineage unclear; slow to adapt.
- Reporting and “single source of truth” logic is buried in disparate tools.

**Modern AE/DE Workflow:**
- All data loaded to warehouse and version-controlled with modular SQL/dbt models.
- Fact and dimension tables built for transparency, reproducibility, and rapid analytics.
- Stakeholder and ops needs drive data model, not legacy IT constraints.
- All transformations, lineage, and metric definitions fully documented and auditable.

## MVP Deliverables

| Module                 | Description                                                    |

- Relationships managed by opaque IDs, with little/no lineage or modularity.
- Logic and metric definitions buried in unversioned SQL/Power BI.
- High ramp-up for new/junior data engineers and slow iteration cycles.

## Technical Q&A Cheat Sheet

**Q: How did you define risk?**  
A: Age, comorbidity count, and prior admissions, with cohort assignment logic documented and adjustable.

**Q: What data did you use?**  
A: All data is synthetic, hand-crafted for analytics prototyping with UK NHS structure, *not* US Synthea.

**Q: How would you scale for a real Trust?**  
A: Modular data models can be adapted for any Trust; clinical validation and data pipeline automation are next steps.
